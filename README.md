# Simple Voyager-inspired Navigation Library

- The unique thing here is that it uses a single class to manage the navigation, so you can actually navigate in Compose or from View Models if it has an instance of the Navigation Manager.
- The code is messy, and you will see some Voyager Screens as I was comparing the behaviour of the two.
- Note: this repo was originally testing the idea of Code Dynamic Loading. It still contains some parts of this test plugin system until I clean it up.
